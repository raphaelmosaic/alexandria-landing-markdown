Alexandria enables technical students, founders, and investors to discuss groundbreaking research with the original authors of a paper.

We founded this organization because we were dissatisfied with the quality of technical conversations in today's “tech meetups”.
Research is accelerating faster than ever before. We see novel breakthroughs in fields such as AI, Robotics, and Biotech on a weekly basis.
There is a need for frontier research circles that go beyond discussing “web apps” or “LLM rag”.

This is why Alexandria circles are designed in the following way:
A spotlight paper is chosen, and experts in the field are selected to speak at the event.
Inspired by the Jeff Bezos 6-six pager everyone reads the same paper at the start of the circle.
Real thought-provoking discussions are impossible with large groups, spots are limited to 15 people.

Ad Astra.
